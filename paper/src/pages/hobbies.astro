        text="Here, I'm a bit of a Renaissance person when it comes to my free time. Let's dive in and explore the weird and wonderful things that keep me occupied when I'm not pretending to be productive!"

    <Collapsible label="- Reading">
        <TextSection
            text="Well, well, well, my dear friends, gather round and let me tell you about the wonders of reading. As a lifelong reader, I can assure you that reading is one of the most rewarding hobbies you can have. Whether you're cozying up with a captivating novel on a dreary day or immersing yourself in an academic textbook for hours on end, reading is a constant source of comfort and intellectual stimulation."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Back in my school days, reading was a real drag. We were assigned books not for their literary merit, but for their ability to teach us vocab or history. We had to read to memorize, not to discuss ideas. The joy of reading was lost in the monotony of analysis and regurgitation."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="But then, I discovered the joy of reading for pleasure, without anyone telling me what to read. Oh, the freedom! I was finally able to explore genres and authors that truly interested me, and it was a game-changer. It reminded me that sometimes the best things in life require a little rebellion against the status quo."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Books have been so much more to me than just entertainment or an academic exercise, a refuge from the world, a place to reflect and process emotions. Sometimes they challenge assumptions and broaden perspective. Other times,they can teach you empathy and understanding people and cultures different from your own."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="I remember reading Animal Farm for the first time and being completely drawn into the story of the farm animals and their struggle for power. The characters were so well-developed that I felt like I was right there in the middle of the action, watching it all unfold. And Crime and Punishment? Don't even get me started! Dostoevsky weaves together philosophy, psychology, and suspense like a true master."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Now, hold on to your hats, because here's the zinger: academic textbooks. I know, I know, they're as thrilling as watching paint dry, but hear me out. When you read an academic book, it's like having a knowledgeable friend, or even a mentor, talking to you and guiding you through a topic. And when you finally grasp a difficult concept, the feeling of accomplishment is unparalleled."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="So, my friends, if you're not already an avid reader, I implore you to give it a try. Don't worry about what others might think of your choices or whether they fit into some prescribed curriculum. Just read what you love and enjoy the ride. And with that, I'm off to curl up with a good book..."

    <Collapsible label="- Note Making">
        <TextSection
            text="As I sit here, surrounded by spreadsheets and notes, I can't help but chuckle at the thought of how much my note-making habit has evolved over the years. It's like watching a caterpillar transform into a butterfly, but instead of wings, I now have an organized collection of notes."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="I remember back in the day, I used to jot down my thoughts on scraps of paper and post-it notes. It was like a game of hide-and-seek, but with my own ideas. I would spend hours searching for that one scrap of paper that held the key to my entire thought process. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but with a needle that kept changing shape and color."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="But then, I discovered vim-wiki. It was like a light shining down from the heavens, illuminating my path to note-making enlightenment. I was able to organize my thoughts and ideas in one place, and it was glorious. But as time went on, I realized that even vim-wiki had its limitations. That's when I fell in love with spreadsheets."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Spreadsheets are like the Swiss Army Knife of note-making. They can do anything from organizing my daily routines to tracking my shopping lists. And the best part? I can color-code everything! It's like being a kid with a brand new pack of markers, but instead of coloring books, I'm coloring my thoughts."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Now, some people might say that organizing your thoughts is a waste of time. But to them, I say, You're missing out, my friend. When I sort and organize my notes, it's like watching a beautiful symphony being conducted right in front of me. Everything falls into place, and suddenly, I have clarity in thought. It's like being able to see the world in HD after living in black and white."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="And don't even get me started on the joy of delegating thinking. It's like outsourcing my brain to my notes. I can free up mental space and focus on other things, like deciding what to have for dinner or whether or not I should buy that new pair of shoes. My notes have become my personal assistants, and I couldn't be happier."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="So, to all you note-making skeptics out there, I urge you to give it a try. You might just find that the key to unlocking your own brilliant thoughts was hidden among the clutter all along."

        <TextSection
            text="As a seasoned gamer, I have spent countless hours in virtual worlds, battling monsters, solving puzzles, and exploring new lands. It is a hobby that has been with me since childhood, and one that I continue to enjoy to this day."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Now, you might be wondering what kind of games I like to play. Well, let me tell you, I have a pretty eclectic taste in games. From the action-packed God of War and Batman Arkham series to the more cerebral Portal and Hitman series, I enjoy them all. I also have a soft spot for adventure games like The Witcher III and Tomb Raider series, as well as indie gems like Inside and Cuphead."

        <TextSection
            text="But what makes playing video games so special to me is not just the thrill of the gameplay, but the artistry that goes into creating them. The level design, the sound effects, the music, all of it comes together to create a unique experience that is truly a work of art. Take a glance at how a game like God of War was made below. "

            text="In fact, I have even dabbled in game design myself. I have taken courses on Unity game engine and have experimented with various open-source game engines, but I have settled on Godot as my tool of choice. I have been reading Wire Frame magazine to learn more about the game design process, and I hope to release my own indie game someday. My favorite genres are stealth, puzzle, and strategy games, so you can expect my game to have those elements."

    <Collapsible label="- Side Projects">
        <TextSection
            text="What are side projects, you ask? Well, let me tell you. They are those wondrous creations that we work on in our spare time, whether it be coding up a new app, building a new electronic gadget, or even designing a new board game. These are the projects that we undertake for no other reason than the sheer joy of building."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="But what drives us to do these things? What deeper psychological forces are at work here? I'm glad you asked. You see, when we engage in side projects, we are tapping into some of the most fundamental aspects of the human psyche."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="First and foremost, there is the joy of creation. There is something deeply satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into something tangible, something that you can hold in your hands and say, I made this. This taps into our need for self-expression and our desire to leave a mark on the world.But it's not just about the end result. There is also something incredibly therapeutic about the act of creating. It allows us to focus our minds and block out the distractions of the world around us. This taps into our need for mindfulness and our desire for control over our own lives."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="For the longest time, I used to create side projects, only to discard them soon after completion. I didn't think that they were significant or groundbreaking enough to warrant attention. However, as I grew older, I began to realize the true value of my work. Each project represented an idea, a spark of creativity that could lead to bigger and better things. Hence, I have now started to document my work, and I am currently in the process of building a website and a YouTube channel to showcase my creations. It's a small step, but I believe that it's a step in the right direction. It's never too late to start, and I urge everyone to do the same. Let's build stuff for the joy of building, and who knows where it might take us!"
        />
        <TextSection
            text="Of course, there are also the downsides to side projects. There is the frustration of hitting a roadblock, the endless hours spent yak shaving (a term used to describe the act of doing a bunch of small, insignificant tasks instead of focusing on the main project), and the occasional failure. But even these experiences are valuable. They teach us perseverance, patience, and the importance of learning from our mistakes."
        />
        <TextSection
            text="And let's not forget about the social aspect of side projects. Whether it's sharing our creations with others or collaborating with like-minded individuals, side projects can be a great way to connect with others and form new relationships. This taps into our need for social interaction and our desire to feel like we are part of something larger than ourselves."

Whether it's delving into a new book, building a side project from scratch, or simply keeping up with the latest tech news, I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow. And let's not forget the importance of taking a break from it all with a nice cup of coffee or tea, or even indulging in some good old-fashioned comfort food. So, I encourage you to explore your own hobbies and interests, whether they're similar to mine or something entirely different. Life is too short to not pursue the things that bring you joy and fulfillment."
