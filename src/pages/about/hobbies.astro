        <p>when I am not working. I am indulged in one of these things :</p>

        <Details summary="Reading">
            <p>
                Back in my school days, reading was a real drag. We were
                assigned books not for their literary merit, but for their
                ability to teach us vocab or history. We had to read to
                memorize, not to discuss ideas. The joy of reading was lost in
                the monotony of analysis and regurgitation.

                But then, I discovered the joy of reading for pleasure, without
                anyone telling me what to read. Oh, the freedom! I was finally
                able to explore genres and authors that truly interested me, and
                it was a game-changer.

                Books have been so much more to me than just entertainment or an
                academic exercise, I remember reading Animal Farm for the first
                time and being completely drawn into the story of the farm
                animals and their struggle for power. The characters were so
                well-developed that I felt like I was right there in the middle
                of the action, watching it all unfold. And Crime and Punishment?
                Don't even get me started! Dostoevsky weaves together
                philosophy, psychology, and suspense like a true master.

                Now, hold on to your hats, because here's the zinger: academic
                textbooks. I know, I know, they're as thrilling as watching
                paint dry, but hear me out. When you read an academic book, it's
                like having a knowledgeable friend, or even a mentor, talking to
                you and guiding you through a topic. And when you finally grasp
                a difficult concept, the feeling of accomplishment is
                unparalleled. So, my friends, if you're not already an avid
                reader, I implore you to give it a try. Don't worry about what
                others might think of your choices or whether they fit into some
                prescribed curriculum. Just read what you love and enjoy the
                ride. And with that, I'm off to curl up with a good book...
