If you are passionate about engineering, have time and can muster some courage, study these books. And you will have ample understanding of the computer science domain to pursue it further in any direction.

If you get stuck, don’t be bummed. These aren’t easy books.

## Prerequisites

- High School Physics
- High School Maths

## Chronology

Before we dive deep into the basics of electronics and how
computers works, you may need to recap physics, hence ... 

- **Fundamentals of Physics** by *David Halliday, Jearl Walker, and Robert Resnick*.
---

Once we know some physics, we can start looking at electronic
devices and see how they work, hence ...

- **Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory**  by *Louis Nashelsky and Robert Boylestad*.
---

After getting familiar with the concepts on which electronic
devices work, we see how these devices were further used to make
more complex systems by studying circuits, hence ...

- **Fundamentals of Electric Circuits**  by *Charles K. Alexander and Matthew N.O. Sadiku*.
- **Foundations of Analog & Digital Circuits**  by *Anant Agarwal*.
---

Finally, we can start looking at computers. Their design,
organisation and architecture, hence ...

- **Computer Organisation and Design**  *by David A Patterson and John L. Hennessy*.
- **Computer Architecture**  by *David A Patterson and John L. Hennessy*.
---

Time to get hands dirty. Learning C, understanding how it interacts
with the computer and then finally, making a computer from scratch.

- **Effective C**  by *Robert C. Seacord*.
- **Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective**  by *Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron*.
- **The Elements of Computing Systems**  by *Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken*.
---

At this point you know something about computers. Congrats !
But as we are learning this skill, we must also be sure how
we use it, hence ...

- **The Innovators's Dilemma**  by *Clayton Christensen*.
- **The Design of Everyday Things**  by *Don Norman*.
---

Now before we start trying different programming languages, we need
to have some idea about computer networks which will inevitably
come handy once you start programming, hence ...

- **Computer Networking**  by *Kurose James F and Ross Keith W*.
---
As a professional in the industry, you should be competent with your tools, be it your os or your editor.
I highly recommend GNU Linux. Hence ...

- **How Linux Works**  by *Brian Ward*.
- **The Linux Commandline**  by *William Shotts*.
---
The next step is to learn algorithms and programming languages,
but before we do. We will learn about git to be able to better
manage the programs we write, starting early with git will make
working with git second nature which will be very very useful later.
hence...

- **Version Control with Git**  by *Jon Loeliger, Matthew McCullough*.
---
Having learnt C, we should now learn about various algorithms :

- **Introduction to Algorithms**  by *Thomas H. Cormen*.
- **Algorithmic Puzzles**  by *Anany Levitin and Maria Levitin*.
---

Once you have some understanding of the above mentioned topics, you can pick any language or framework,
and learn to develop with that. Below are some domains you may wanna try :

- [Web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [react](https://react.dev/).
- App development with [flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) or [swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/).
- Building APIs with [go](https://go.dev/) or cli-apps with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Game development with [godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/introduction.html), [unity](https://unity.com/) or [unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).

Whatever direction you choose, you will realise there are more than one way to do things. So find a problem worth your time, and start building for it !
