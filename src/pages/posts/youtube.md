I have had some success with youtube in the past, I had uploaded a video on how we can scrape websites for data, and the video had gotten few thousand views over a few months. 
While this number may seem small, given the niche of the topic I was surprised by the response. Later, about 300 users also subscribed, probably as a way to bookmark my channel.

This was 2 years back. I had to relocate then, and hence could not give time to youtube anymore. Now, the conditions are more favorable to start youtube again, especially given my new workspace and computer that I have assembed.
I have setup OBS and my workspace to be youtube ready. I want that I should be able to start recording a video with zero resistance. I also don't want to do much post processing hence I am looking for a video format that will work.
Everything is setup I just need to finalize my lighting and backdrop, post which the studio will be ready. And only actually making videos will remain ...

I'm still not sure what video I'll post first, but since web scraping worked last time, I wanna try something similar. I guess people are intrigued by automation and getting insights from data. I also want the content to have some structure, hence I want to develop playlists. Perhaps I'm thinking too much. Haha.
Super excited to pursue it again. And it'll be fun to find out how it turns out in a year or so.

Let's see ...
