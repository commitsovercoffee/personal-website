    Victor Frankenstein, a Swiss scientist, has a great ambition: to create
    intelligent life. But when his creature first stirs, he realizes he has made
    a monster. A monster which, abandoned by his master and shunned by everyone
    who sees it, follows Dr Frankenstein to the very ends of the earth.
